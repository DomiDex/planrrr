### Compliance
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified
- [ ] CCPA compliance verified
- [ ] SOC2 requirements met
- [ ] Data encryption at rest verified
- [ ] Data encryption in transit verified
- [ ] Right to deletion implemented

## üîÑ Secret Rotation

### Rotation Schedule
- [ ] Database passwords: Every 90 days
- [ ] API keys: Every 90 days
- [ ] OAuth secrets: Every 180 days
- [ ] Encryption keys: Every 365 days (with migration plan)
- [ ] JWT secrets: Every 90 days

### Rotation Process
- [ ] Rotation scripts are tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure is documented
- [ ] Zero-downtime rotation is implemented
- [ ] Old secrets are securely deleted
- [ ] Rotation is logged and audited

## üöÄ Deployment Platforms

### Vercel Configuration
```bash
# Set secrets via Vercel CLI
vercel env add BETTER_AUTH_SECRET production
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
vercel env add ENCRYPTION_SECRET production
# ... add all required secrets
```

### Railway Configuration
```bash
# Set secrets via Railway CLI
railway variables set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="<value>"
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="<value>"
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_SECRET="<value>"
# ... add all required secrets
```

### Docker Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (use secrets, not environment)
services:
  web:
    secrets:
      - better_auth_secret
      - database_url
      - encryption_secret

secrets:
  better_auth_secret:
    external: true
  database_url:
    external: true
  encryption_secret:
    external: true
```

## üìù Final Verification

Before deployment, run:

```bash
# Validate all environment variables
pnpm --filter @repo/env check --report

# Check for exposed secrets
pnpm --filter @repo/env check --secrets

# Generate security report
pnpm audit

# Test with production-like environment
NODE_ENV=production pnpm build
NODE_ENV=production pnpm start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Procedures

### If a Secret is Compromised:
1. Immediately rotate the compromised secret
2. Invalidate all sessions/tokens using that secret
3. Check logs for unauthorized access
4. Notify security team
5. Document incident
6. Update security procedures

### Secret Recovery:
1. Secrets should be backed up in secure vault
2. Recovery requires two-person authorization
3. All recovery actions are logged
4. Test recovery procedure quarterly

## üìã Sign-off

- [ ] Security team has reviewed configuration
- [ ] DevOps team has verified infrastructure
- [ ] All REQUIRED items are checked
- [ ] Secrets are documented in secure location
- [ ] Team is trained on security procedures
