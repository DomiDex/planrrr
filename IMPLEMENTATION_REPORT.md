## üìù Recommendations

1. **Hire or allocate 2 developers** for 1 month to reach MVP
2. **Focus on 2 platforms first** (Facebook + Twitter) rather than all 4
3. **Use managed services** to reduce complexity (Clerk for auth, Uploadthing for media)
4. **Consider buying UI components** (Tailwind UI) to save time
5. **Implement feature flags** to ship incrementally
6. **Set up error tracking immediately** to catch issues early
7. **Create a staging environment** before adding more features

---

## üöÄ Conclusion

The infrastructure is **production-ready**, but the application needs **~114 hours of focused development** to become a functioning MVP. The highest priority is implementing authentication, which blocks all other features. With dedicated resources, a working MVP can be achieved in **4-5 weeks**.

**Recommendation**: Allocate 2 developers full-time for 1 month, or hire contractors to accelerate development. The current skeleton is solid and can support rapid feature development once the core authentication and API integration are complete.
