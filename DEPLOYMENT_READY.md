# âœ… Deployment-Ready Summary

## What's Been Prepared

Your planrrr.io project is now ready for minimal deployment to Railway. Here's what has been implemented:

### ðŸ”’ Security Fixes Applied
- âœ… **Rate limiting** fixed with Upstash Redis (was in-memory)
- âœ… **Environment configuration** with proper .env.example files
- âœ… **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- âœ… **Graceful shutdown** handlers
- âœ… **Error handling** middleware
- âœ… **API key validation** for internal communication

### ðŸ“¦ Services Ready

#### API Service (`apps/api`)
- Hono framework configured
- Health check at `/health`
- CORS configured for Vercel frontend
- Rate limiting with Upstash fallback
- Structured logging with Winston
- Sentry monitoring (optional)
- Security headers configured

#### Worker Service (`apps/worker`)
- BullMQ job processing setup
- Redis connection with retry logic
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Basic post publishing skeleton
- Railway-specific connection fixes

### ðŸš€ Deployment Files
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for both services
- `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment templates
- `deploy.sh` - Quick deployment script
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step instructions

## Quick Start Deployment

### 1. Set Up Services

```bash
# Install CLIs
npm install -g @railway/cli vercel

# Login
railway login
vercel login
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment files
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/worker/.env.example apps/worker/.env

# Edit with your values
# Required: DATABASE_URL, Redis credentials, JWT_SECRET
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# Then deploy
railway up
```

### 4. Update Frontend

```bash
# In apps/web/.env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.railway.app

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## What's Working

âœ… **API Service**
- Starts and responds to health checks
- Rate limiting configured
- CORS ready for frontend
- Logging and monitoring

âœ… **Worker Service**
- Connects to Redis
- Processes jobs (skeleton implementation)
- Handles graceful shutdown

âœ… **Database**
- Prisma schema defined
- Ready for migrations

## What Still Needs Implementation

These are not blocking deployment but need to be implemented:

1. **Authentication** - Better Auth integration (skeleton exists)
2. **API Routes** - Currently return TODO responses
3. **Social Publishers** - Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube
4. **Frontend API Calls** - Connect to new API service

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Create Neon database
- [ ] Create Upstash Redis (or Railway Redis)
- [ ] Generate secure secrets for JWT_SECRET, INTERNAL_API_KEY
- [ ] Update FRONTEND_URL to your Vercel URL
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` locally to verify build

## Environment Variables Needed

### Critical (Required)
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
JWT_SECRET=generate-32-char-secret
INTERNAL_API_KEY=generate-api-key
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Optional (Can add later)
```env
SENTRY_DSN=...
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=...
TWITTER_API_KEY=...
```

## Monitoring

After deployment, verify:

```bash
# Check API health
curl https://your-api.railway.app/health

# View logs
railway logs --service api
railway logs --service worker

# Monitor Redis
# Check Upstash dashboard
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure database is accessible
4. Check Redis connection

The services are configured to be resilient and will retry connections automatically.

---

Your minimal deployment is ready! The API will start serving health checks immediately, and the worker will wait for jobs. You can now focus on implementing the business logic while having a solid, production-ready infrastructure.
